Sky components models for PySM 3
--------------------------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/simonsobs/so_pysm_models.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/simonsobs/so_pysm_models)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/so-pysm-models/badge/?version=latest)](https://so-pysm-models.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

**Repository obsolete**: most of the models available here are superseeded by models in PySM 3.4.0, once Websky is implemented in PySM, this repository will be archived and not used anymore.

See <https://github.com/simonsobs/map_based_simulations>

**WARNING**: `so_pysm_models`, starting from version 1.0, requires PySM 3, install it from <https://github.com/healpy/pysm>
This breaking change was required to reduce memory consumption of PySM for TOD simulations.

## Reference frame

Up to version 1.0, galactic emissions were defined in Galactic reference frame and Extragalactic in Equatorial.
Starting from version 2.0, everything is in Equatorial.
